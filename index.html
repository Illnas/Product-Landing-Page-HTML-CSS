          four players to play together. It was released for Microsoft Windows,

          is also planned to release on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5;

          Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is
          home to seven distinct nations, each of which is tied to an element
          and ruled by a god associated with it. The story follows a twin,
          referred to as the Traveler, who has traveled across many worlds with
          their twin but has become separated from them by an unknown god in
          Teyvat. The Traveler travels across Teyvat in search of the lost
          sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the
          affairs of the other nations, gods, and the world.
